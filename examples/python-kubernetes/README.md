# python-kubernetes

A CDK for Terraform application in Python to demonstrate use of the Kubernetes Provider according to the [HashiCorp Learn Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/kubernetes/deploy-nginx-kubernetes).

## Usage

Install Pipenv using Homebrew by running:
  
```bash
$ brew install pipenv
```
You can install Pipenv by visiting the [website](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

Install project dependencies

```shell
pipenv install
```

Generate CDK for Terraform constructs for Terraform providers and modules used in the project.

```bash
cdktf get
```

You can now edit the `main.py` file if you want to modify any code.

Compile and generate Terraform configuration

```bash
cdktf synth
```

The above command will create a folder called `cdktf.out` that contains all Terraform JSON configuration that was generated.

Next, deploy your Terraform configuration. 
```bash
cdktf deploy
```

Alternately, you can run Terraform commands to apply your configuration.

```bash
cd cdktf.out
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

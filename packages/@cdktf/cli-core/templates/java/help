Use Providers:

  You can add prebuilt providers (if available) or locally generated ones using the add command:
  
  cdktf provider add "aws@~>3.0" null kreuzwerker/docker

  All prebuilt providers are available on Maven Central: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.hashicorp
  You can also add these providers directly to your pom.xml file.

  You can also build any module or provider locally. Learn more: https://cdk.tf/modules-and-providers

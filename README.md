CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for Terraform allows developers to use familiar
programming languages to define cloud infrastructure and provision it through
HashiCorp Terraform.

## Overview

The CDK for Terraform project helps users define infrastructure resources using their programming language of choice and generates a Terraform configuration in JSON that can be applied with `terraform apply`.

The CDK for Terraform project includes two packages:

* [cdktf-cli](./packages/cdktf-cli) - A CLI that allows users to run commands to initialize, import, and synthesize CDK for Terraform applications.
* [cdktf](./packages/cdktf-cli) - A library for defining Terraform resources using programming constructs.

## Getting Started

Choose a language:
* [TypeScript](./docs/getting-started/typescript.md)

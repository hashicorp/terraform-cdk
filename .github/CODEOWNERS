# We use this for automatic PR review assignment within Github.
# If individual users are specified in this file, this is mainly to
# inform them of certain PRs and we don't require a review from them
# to be able to merge PRs.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence, 
# they will be requested for review when someone opens a 
# pull request.

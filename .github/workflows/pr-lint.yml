          subjectPatternError: |
            The subject "{subject}" found in the pull request title "{title}" does not match the required format.
            The format is "type(scope): message", supported types are feat, fix, chore, refactor, revert.
            The supported scopes are lib, cli, hcl2json, tests, examples, readme, docs, release, deps.
            Please stick to the format so that our automatic release process picks your commit up and
            your code makes it into the next release.

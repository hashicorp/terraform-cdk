# Core Library API Reference

The CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) core library lets you define infrastructure resources using familiar programming languages. CDKTF translates the API into the following supported languages:

- [Typescript](/cdktf/api-reference/typescript)
- [Python](/cdktf/api-reference/python)
- [Java](/cdktf/api-reference/java)
- [CSharp](/cdktf/api-reference/csharp)
- [Go](/cdktf/api-reference/go)

In addition to the core library, you can use [generated provider bindings](/cdktf/concepts/providers) and [Constructs](https://constructs.dev/search?q=&cdk=cdktf&offset=0) in CDKTF applications.

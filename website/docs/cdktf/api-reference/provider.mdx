# Provider API Reference

A provider is a Terraform plugin that allows users to manage an external API. You can use CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) with every provider available on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). Refer to [Providers](/cdktf/concepts/providers) for details about how to import and use providers in your CDKTF application.

We offer several popular providers as pre-built packages to help reduce the time required to generate provider code bindings for your CDKTF application. These pre-build providers are available in the CDKTF [GitHub namespace](https://github.com/topics/pre-built-provider).

Documentation for CDKTF provider bindings is available on the [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/search?cdk=cdktf&sort=downloadsDesc&offset=0).

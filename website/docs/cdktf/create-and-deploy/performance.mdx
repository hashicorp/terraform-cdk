# Synthesization Performance

The faster you can synthesize your CDKTF code, the faster you can deploy it.
This page focuses on how to optimize your CDK for Terraform performance.

## TypeScript

In TypeScript, the main bottleneck for synthesization performance is the time it takes `ts-node` or `tsc` to compile your code.
The easiest way to improve this is using explicit resource imports like `import { MyResource } from '@cdktf/provider-my-provider/lib/my-resource'` instead of star imports like `import * as myProvider from '@cdktf/provider-my-provider'`.
Another option is to use a bundler without typechecking like [`tsx`](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx) or [`swc`](https://swc.rs/) to compile your code. These are typically a lot faster than `tsc` or `ts-node`, but you will get no typechecking.

## Python

Python is out of the box optimized for synthesization performance. There are no known steps to improve the synthesization performance.

## Java

To improve the synthesization performance of Java, we recommend using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) over [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). In an example using the AWS provider, we observed an improvement from 3m 30s to 30s after the initial compilation. To migrate to Gradle, we recommend creating a new CDKTF project and copying the code over.

## C#

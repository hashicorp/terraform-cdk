# Synthetisation Performance

The faster you can synthesise your CDKTF code, the faster you can deploy it.
This page focusse on how to optimise your CDK for Terraform performance.

## Typescript

In Typescript the main bottleneck for synthetisation performance is the time it takes `ts-node` or `tsc` to compile your code.
The easiest way to improve this is using explicit resource imports like `import { MyResource } from '@cdktf/provider-my-provider/lib/my-resource'` instead of star imports like `import * as myProvider from '@cdktf/provider-my-provider'`.
Another option is to use a bundler without typechecking like [`tsx`](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx) or [`swc`](https://swc.rs/) to compile your code. These are typically a lot faster than `tsc` or `ts-node`, but you will get no typechecking.

## Python

Python is out of the box optimized for synthetisation performance, there a no known steps to improve the synthetisation performance.

## Java

To improve the synthetisation performance of Java we recommend using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) over [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). We could observe an improvement for an example using the AWS provider from 3m 30s to 30s after the initial compilation. To migrate to Gradle we recommend creating a new CDKTF project and copying the code over.

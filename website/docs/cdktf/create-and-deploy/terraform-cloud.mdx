# Terraform Cloud

This page explains how to connect Terraform Cloud to your CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) application and the benefits of using these products together.

> **Hands On:** Try our [Get Started - Terraform Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/cloud-get-started) tutorials.

## What are Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise?

CDKTF supports [Terraform Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) and [Terraform Enterprise](/enterprise).

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that runs Terraform in a stable, remote environment and securely stores state and secrets. It includes a user interface that helps you better understand your Terraform operations and resources, allows you to define role-based access controls, and offers a private registry for sharing modules and providers. Terraform Cloud also integrates with the Terraform CLI and connects to common version control systems (VCS) like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. When you connect a Terraform Cloud workspace to a VCS repository, new commits and changes can automatically trigger Terraform plans. Terraform Cloud also offers an API, allowing you to integrate it into existing workflows.

Terraform Enterprise lets you set up a self-hosted distribution of Terraform Cloud and is ideal for organizations with strict security and compliance requirements.

## When to use Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise?

Terraform uses persisted state data to keep track of the real-world resources it manages. By default, Terraform writes state to a local file. We recommend integrating with Terraform Cloud to store state remotely. This prevents accidental loss of locally stored state and lets multiple people access the state data so they can work together on that collection of infrastructure resources.

Other benefits of Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise include the ability to run Terraform remotely, [manage variables and secrets](#manage-variables-and-secrets), and enforce [policies for sets of infrastructure](#policy-enforcement). 

## Set up CDKTF with Terraform Cloud

After you sign up for a [Terraform Cloud Account](https://app.terraform.io/public/signup/account), you must connect your CDKTF project to one or more [Terraform Cloud workspaces](/cloud-docs/workspaces).

[Workspaces](/cloud-docs/workspaces) function like working directories for distinct Terraform configurations and are associated with a Terraform configuration and its state file. Workspaces can also contain variables that you can use for credential management. By default, workspaces are created in [Remote Execution Mode](/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations), which enables Terraform Cloud to store Terraform state and run Terraform operations remotely.

When you create a new workspace you can choose to set up the CLI-driven workflow, the Version control workflow, or the API-driven workflow (a more advanced option to integrate Terraform Cloud into a larger pipeline.

### CLI-driven Workflow

You can configure the Terraform Cloud CLI-driven workflow for both new and existing CDKTF projects.

### Connect New CDKTF Projects

For new projects, run cdktf init without passing the `--local` flag. CDKTF will use your stored Terraform Cloud credentials to create a new workspace. If you have no stored Terraform Cloud credentials, CDKTF will ask you to login.

After you login, CDKTF creates a new scaffolded project that is configured to use Terraform state with a remote backend. Will TFC automatically st the workspace to remote execution??

### Connect Existing CDKTF Projects

For existing projects, do the following:

1. Create a Terraform Cloud workspace with the CLI-driven workflow.
2. Add the RemoteBackend to your CDKTF program.

```ts
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack, RemoteBackend } from "cdktf";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    // Remote Backend - /docs/backends/types/remote.html
    new RemoteBackend(this, {
      // You can omit this if you are not using a self-hosted Terraform enterprise instance
      hostname: "app.terraform.io",
      organization: "company",

      workspaces: {
        name: "my-app-prod",
      },
    });

    // define resources here
  }
}

const app = new App();
const myStack = new MyStack(app, "my-stack");
// Instead of defining the backend within the stack you can do it also on the outside like this:
// new RemoteBackend(myStack, {
//     hostname: "app.terraform.io",
//     organization: "company",

//     workspaces: {
//     name: "my-app-prod",
//     },
// });
// You just need to make sure you configure this before the app.synth() call
app.synth();
```

3. Run `cdktf init` so that you can actually log into TFC
4. Run `cdktf deploy` / `cdktf plan` / `cdktf destroy` like normally. You can also configure secrets, see the example below.

### VCS-driven Workflow

You can check your synthesized code into version control and use the VCS-driven workflow. [You can find detailed explanations here.](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/deployment-patterns#deploy-with-terraform-and-terraform-cloud)

## Managing Variables and Secrets through Terraform Cloud

You can use [Variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables) to define variables and secrets to use during the execution of a plan / apply / destroy operation in Terraform Cloud. You can manage multiple secrets across multiple workspaces by using [variable sets](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#variable-sets).

To be able to use variables you have to enable [remote operations](/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations) for your Terraform Cloud workspace, this means that not a local Terraform CLI but Terraform Cloud is used to execute the run.

To declare variables you can use the `TerraformVariable` construct which renders an [Input Variable](/language/values/variables):

```ts
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack, TerraformVariable } from "cdktf";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    // You can configure the variable 'my-var' in Terraform Cloud and use the value throughout your CDKTF application
    const value = new TerraformVariable(this, "my-var", {
      default: "The default value to use",
      description: "",
      nullable: false, // if passing no
      sensitive: true,
      type: "string",
    });

    // define resources here
  }
}
```

Please bear in mind that the return value is an object with various token representations of the value as attributes. You can pass it as a string via `value.stringValue`, as a number via `value.numberValue`, or as a list via `value.listValue`. This means during synthesization there is no real value in the field, only a [Token](/cdktf/concepts/tokens). Tokens can not be used in dynamic checks during the runtime, e.g. `if (value.listValue.length > 42) {` will always return `false` as tokenized lists have a static length of one item.

## Continuous Integration

To run Terraform Cloud in a CI workflow you can either use [Terraform Clouds VCS option directly](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/deployment-patterns#deploy-with-terraform-and-terraform-cloud) or use a [general-purpose CI to trigger the run in Terraform Cloud](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/deployment-patterns#github-actions-ci-and-terraform-cloud). To learn more about when to use what visit our [Deployment Pattern docs](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/deployment-patterns).

## Policy Enforcement

-> **Note:** Sentinel policies and run tasks are available as part of the Terraform Cloud **Team & Governance** upgrade package. Refer to [Terraform Cloud pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.

You can define [Sentinel policies](/cloud-docs/sentinel) for one or multiple Terraform Cloud workspaces to ensure that your infrastructure follows company-wide security standards and best practices. You can use Sentinel policies with CDKTF if Terraform Cloud is configured as a backend.

You can also use [Run Tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) to directly integrate third-party tools and services at certain stages in the Terraform Cloud run lifecycle. Terraform Cloud uses the status response from the third-party tool to determine if a run should proceed.

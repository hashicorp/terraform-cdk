# Terraform Cloud

This page explains how to connect Terraform Cloud to your CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) application and the benefits of using these products together.

## What are Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise?

CDKTF supports [Terraform Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) and [Terraform Enterprise](/enterprise).

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS application that runs Terraform in a stable, remote environment and securely stores state and secrets. It includes a user interface that helps you better understand your Terraform operations and resources, allows you to define role-based access controls, and offers a private registry for sharing modules and providers. Terraform Cloud also integrates with the Terraform CLI and connects to common version control systems (VCS) like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. When you connect a Terraform Cloud workspace to a VCS repository, new commits and changes can automatically trigger Terraform plans. Terraform Cloud also offers an API, allowing you to integrate it into existing workflows.

Terraform Enterprise lets you set up a self-hosted distribution of Terraform Cloud and is ideal for organizations with strict security and compliance requirements.

## When to use Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise?

Terraform uses persisted state data to keep track of the real-world resources it manages. By default, Terraform writes state to a local file. We recommend integrating with Terraform Cloud to store state remotely. This prevents accidental loss of locally stored state and lets multiple people access the state data so they can work together on that collection of infrastructure resources.

Other benefits of Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise include the ability to run Terraform remotely, [manage variables and secrets](#manage-variables-and-secrets), and enforce [policies for sets of infrastructure](#policy-enforcement). 

## Set up CDKTF with Terraform Cloud

After you sign up for a [Terraform Cloud Account](https://app.terraform.io/public/signup/account), you must connect your CDKTF project to one or more [Terraform Cloud workspaces](/cloud-docs/workspaces).

[Workspaces](/cloud-docs/workspaces) function like working directories for distinct Terraform configurations and are associated with a Terraform configuration and its state file. Workspaces can also contain variables that you can use for credential management. By default, workspaces are created in [Remote Execution Mode](/cloud-docs/run/remote-operations), which enables Terraform Cloud to store Terraform state and run Terraform operations remotely.

When you create a new workspace you can choose to set up the CLI-driven workflow, the Version control workflow, or the API-driven workflow (a more advanced option to integrate Terraform Cloud into a larger pipeline.

### CLI-driven Workflow

You can configure the Terraform Cloud [CLI-driven workflow](/cloud-docs/run/cli) for both new and existing CDKTF projects. This workflow lets you run CDKTF CLI commands to deploy your application execute Terraform operations remotely on Terraform Cloud.

### Connect New CDKTF Projects

For new projects, run cdktf init without passing the `--local` flag. CDKTF uses your stored Terraform Cloud credentials to create a new workspace. If you have no stored Terraform Cloud credentials, CDKTF asks you to log in.

After you log in, CDKTF creates a new scaffolded project that is configured to store Terraform state in the Terraform Cloud workspace. 

### Connect Existing CDKTF Projects

For existing projects, do the following:

1. Create a Terraform Cloud workspace with the CLI-driven workflow.
2. Add the `RemoteBackend` to your CDKTF application.

```ts
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack, RemoteBackend } from "cdktf";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    // Remote Backend - /docs/backends/types/remote.html
    new RemoteBackend(this, {
      // You can omit this if you are not using a self-hosted Terraform enterprise instance.
      hostname: "app.terraform.io",
      organization: "company",

      workspaces: {
        name: "my-app-prod",
      },
    });

    // define resources here
  }
}

const app = new App();
const myStack = new MyStack(app, "my-stack");
// You can also define the backend outside of the stack.
// new RemoteBackend(myStack, {
//     hostname: "app.terraform.io",
//     organization: "company",

//     workspaces: {
//     name: "my-app-prod",
//     },
// });
// You must configure the RemoteBackend before the app.synth() call
app.synth();
```

3. Run `cdktf init` and log in to Terraform Cloud.

### VCS-driven Workflow

Check your synthesized code into version control and connect your Terraform Cloud workspace to that repository with the VCS-driven workflow. Refer to [Deployment Patterns](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/deployment-patterns#deploy-with-terraform-and-terraform-cloud) for more details about how to use CDKTF with the VCS-driven workflow.

## Managing Variables and Secrets through Terraform Cloud

Terraform Cloud [variables](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables) let you define the variables and secrets that Terraform uses during remote operations. You can set variables specifically for each workspace or you can create variable sets to reuse the same variables across multiple workspaces. For example, you could define a variable set of provider credentials and automatically apply it to all of the workspaces using that provider. 

To use variables, set your workspace to [Remote Execution Mode](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#execution-mode). Terraform can only access workspace variables when executing remotely on Terraform Cloud. 

Use the `TerraformVariable` construct to declare variables in your CDKTF application. This creates an undefined [Terraform input variable](/language/values/variables). The following example demonstrates how to create a `TerraformVariable` called `my-var`. 

```ts
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack, TerraformVariable } from "cdktf";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    // You can configure the variable 'my-var' in Terraform Cloud and use the value throughout your CDKTF application
    const value = new TerraformVariable(this, "my-var", {
      default: "The default value to use",
      description: "",
      nullable: false, // if passing no
      sensitive: true,
      type: "string",
    });

    // define resources here
  }
}
```
After you declare a variable in your CDKTF application, you must [add it to your Terraform Cloud workspace](/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#add-a-variable) so that Terraform can access the value during plan, apply, and destroy operations.

### Variable Return Values

The return value for `TerraformVariable` is an object with various token representations of the value as attributes. You can pass this object as a string with `value.stringValue`, as a number with `value.numberValue`, or as a list with `value.listValue`. 

This means that there is no actual value in the variable field when CDKTF synthesizes your application. Instead, CDKTF uses a [Token](/cdktf/concepts/tokens), which represents a value that is unknown until Terraform applies your configuration. You cannot use tokens in dynamic checks during the runtime. For example, `if (value.listValue.length > 42) {` always returns `false` because tokenized lists have a static length of one item.

## Continuous Integration

To run Terraform Cloud in a CI workflow, you can either use [Terraform Cloud's VCS-driven workflow](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/deployment-patterns#deploy-with-terraform-and-terraform-cloud) or use a [general-purpose CI to trigger the run in Terraform Cloud](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/deployment-patterns#github-actions-ci-and-terraform-cloud). 

## Policy Enforcement

-> **Note:** Sentinel policies and run tasks are available as part of the Terraform Cloud **Team & Governance** upgrade package. Refer to [Terraform Cloud pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) for details.

You can define [Sentinel policies](/cloud-docs/sentinel) for one or multiple Terraform Cloud workspaces to ensure that your infrastructure follows company-wide security standards and best practices. You can use Sentinel policies with CDKTF if Terraform Cloud is configured as a backend.

You can also use [Run Tasks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) to directly integrate third-party tools and services at certain stages in the Terraform Cloud run lifecycle. Terraform Cloud uses the status response from the third-party tool to determine if a run should proceed.

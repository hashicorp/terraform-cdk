# Construct Publishing and Distribution

Custom construct classes are reusable infrastructure configurations written in a programming language. After you [write a custom construct](/terraform/cdktf/develop-custom-constructs/construct-design), you can translate it to multiple languages and publish it for others to import and use in CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) applications.

## Translate Constructs to Terraform Modules

You can write a CDKTF construct class and then synthesize the code into an HCL [Terraform module](/terraform/language/modules). When you use this approach, you are limited to the structure and functionality available in a Terraform module. For example, you cannot use enums or methods to provide advanced configuration options.

Use the [cdktf-tf-module-stack](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-tf-module-stack) to transform your code into a Terraform module. This library exposes `TFModuleStack`, `TFModuleVariable`, `TFModuleOutput` constructs that you can use as replacements for `TerraformStack`, `TerraformVariable`, `TerraformOutput`.

The library also offers a `ProviderRequirement` construct that replaces the provider construct you typically use in CDKTF applications. Typical provider constructs pin a specific provider version, but the `ProviderRequirement `construct lets you select a version range. This behavior more closely matches how many modules specify provider versions.

The following example shows a CDKTF program written using the `cdktf-tf-module-stack` library. CDKTF could then [synthesize](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#synth) this code into a `cdktf.tf.json` file to use with Terraform. If you want to use this module, you need to list the full path to the folder containing the synthesized file, such as `../my-cdktf-application/cdktf.out/stacks/my-awesome-module`.

```typescript
import { App } from "cdktf";
import {
  TFModuleStack,
  TFModuleVariable,
  TFModuleOutput,
  ProviderRequirement,
} from "cdktf-tf-module-stack";
import { Resource } from "@cdktf/provider-null";

class MyAwesomeModule extends TFModuleStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    new ProviderRequirement(this, "null", "~> 2.0");
    const resource = new Resource(this, "resource");

    new TFModuleVariable(this, "my_var", {
      type: "string",
      description: "A variable",
      default: "default",
    });

    new TFModuleOutput(this, "my_output", {
      value: resource.id,
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyAwesomeModule(app, "my-awesome-module");
app.synth();
```

### Publish Translated HCL Modules

Follow the [Terraform module publishing requirements and instructions](/terraform/registry/modules/publish). You can use the [projen-cdktf-hybrid-construct](https://github.com/cdktf/projen-cdktf-hybrid-construct) to make this workflow easier. Refer to the [CDK Day 2022 talk](https://cdk.tf/cdk-day-2022-hybrid-modules) on this topic for more details.

## Publish Constructs with Projen

We recommend using the [`cdktf-construct` projen template](https://github.com/projen/projen/blob/main/src/cdktf/cdktf-construct.ts) to package and publish your constructs to either public or private registries. [Projen](https://github.com/projen/projen) synthesizes files and directories into different target languages based on a Javascript or Typescript file. The process is similar to how CDKTF synthesizes code into JSON configuration files for Terraform.

The projen deployment mechanism uses GitHub Actions, so `cdktf-construct` expects GitHub to host the Git repository for your construct package. If you prefer to use a different CI provider, you can use projen to bootstrap the project, run `yarn run eject` to opt out of projen, and then customize the CI implementation.

Use the following steps to publish your constructs with the `cdktf-construct` projen template.

### Initialize Construct Package

Navigate into your construct directory and run `npx projen new cdktf-construct` to initialize a new construct package. The script creates a new project that you can configure and then deploy to private or public registries.

### Configure the Construct Project

Projen manages all non-code files, like the package.json or JSII configuration, so must modify the `.projenrc.js` configuration to include your construct's code files.

The following example shows how to configure your `.projenrc.js` file to publish your project to public or private registries.

```typescript
const { cdktf } = require("projen");
const project = new cdktf.ConstructLibraryCdktf({
  author: "Your Name",
  authorAddress: "your-name@company.com",
  cdktfVersion: "0.13.0",
  defaultReleaseBranch: "main",
  name: "your-project-name",
  repositoryUrl: "https://github.com/your-org/your-project-name.git",
  prettier: true, // optional, but convenient

  // Release Configuration

  // Requires "NPM_TOKEN" secret to be set in the secrets of the Github repository
  releaseToNpm: true,
  npmRegistryUrl: "https://npm.pkg.your-company.com", // When omitted it will release to the public NPM registry

  // Requires "TWINE_USERNAME" & "TWINE_PASSWORD" secret to be set in the repository
  publishToPypi: {
    distName: "your-project-name",
    module: "your_project_name",
    twineRegistryUrl: "https://pypi.your-company.com", // When omitted it will release to the public PyPi registry
  },

  // Requires "MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY", "MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE", "MAVEN_PASSWORD",
  // "MAVEN_USERNAME", and "MAVEN_STAGING_PROFILE_ID" to be set.
  publishToMaven: {
    javaPackage: "com.your-org.your-project-name ",
    mavenGroupId: "com.your-org",
    mavenArtifactId: "your-project-name",
    mavenRepositoryUrl:
      "https://maven.your-company.com/repository/your-project", // When omitted, the project releases to Maven Central
  },

  // Requires "NUGET_API_KEY" to be set.
  publishToNuget: {
    dotNetNamespace: "YourOrg.YourProjectName",
    packageId: "YourOrg.YourProjectName",
    nugetServer: "https://nuget.your-company.com", // When omitted it will release to the public Nuget registry
  },
});

// You should use pre-built providers as peer dependencies so your
// package manager can warn you if you have incompatible versions
project.addPeerDeps(
  "@cdktf/provider-aws@10.x", // You want to pin the major version to stay
  "@cdktf/provider-pagerduty@3.x", // compatible with the current cdktf version
  "@cdktf/provider-datadog@3.x",
);

project.synth();
```

Run `npm run projen` to generate the setup and workflow files for your project You must do this every time you change the `.projenrc.js` file.

### Set GitHub Actions Secrets

The GitHub Action requires the following environment variables for credentials.

- `NPM_TOKEN`: An [npm API token](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-token) or a token for the registry of your choice
- `TWINE_USERNAME`: The username to use for PyPi, if using a token it should be "**token**"
- `TWINE_PASSWORD`: [The PyPi API token](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/) to authenticate against PyPi or the registry of your choice
- `NUGET_API_KEY`: The API key to authenticate against NuGet

The following environment variables are for Maven credentials:

- `MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`
- `MAVEN_PASSWORD`
- `MAVEN_USERNAME`
- `MAVEN_STAGING_PROFILE_ID`

This configuration creates new releases when you push a new commit to the repository. The version numbers follow [semantic versioning specifications](https://semver.org/).

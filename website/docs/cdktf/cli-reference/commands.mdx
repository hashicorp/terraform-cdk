# CLI Commands

The CDK for Terraform CLI has the following commands:

- [completion](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#completion)
- [convert](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#convert)
- [deploy](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#deploy)
- [destroy](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#destroy)
- [diff](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#diff)
- [get](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#get)
- [init](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#init)
- [login](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#login)
- [synth](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#synth)
- [watch](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#watch)
- [output](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#output)

## completion

This command outputs a script that you can use to set up autocompletion for bash or zsh.

```
> cdktf completion

#compdef cdktf
###-begin-cdktf-completions-###
#
# yargs command completion script
#
# Installation: cdktf completion >> ~/.zshrc
#    or cdktf completion >> ~/.zsh_profile on OSX.
#
_cdktf_yargs_completions()
{
  local reply
  local si=$IFS
  IFS=$'
' reply=($(COMP_CWORD="$((CURRENT-1))" COMP_LINE="$BUFFER" COMP_POINT="$CURSOR" cdktf --get-yargs-completions "${words[@]}"))
  IFS=$si
  _describe 'values' reply
}
compdef _cdktf_yargs_completions cdktf
###-end-cdktf-completions-###

```

The output also contains the installation instructions. For example, here are the instructions for Mac OSX:

```
cdktf completion >> ~/.bash_profile on OSX.
# or if using zsh instead of bash
cdktf completion >> ~/.zshrc
```

After you configure auto completion, reload your shell by running `source ~/.zshrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile` or opening a new terminal window. You can now autocomplete `cdktf` commands by pressing the `<TAB>` key. You may need to enter a space after `cdktf` for autocomplete to take effect.

```
> cdktf <TAB>
completion  -- generate completion script
convert     -- Converts a single file of HCL configuration to CDK for Terraform. Takes the file to be converted on stdin.
deploy      -- Deploy the given stacks
destroy     -- Destroy the given stacks
diff        -- Perform a diff (terraform plan) for the given stack
get         -- Generate CDK Constructs for Terraform providers and modules.
init        -- Create a new cdktf project from a template.
list        -- List stacks in app.
login       -- Retrieves an API token to connect to Terraform Cloud.
synth       -- Synthesizes Terraform code for the given app in a directory.
watch       -- [experimental] Watch for file changes and automatically trigger a deploy
```

## convert

This command converts Terraform configuration written in HCL to the equivalent configuration in your preferred language.

->**Note**: The `convert` command is only functional for Terraform 1.0 and above. There are also [known limitations](https://cdk.tf/convert-limitations).

```
cdktf convert [OPTIONS]

Converts a single file of HCL configuration to CDK for Terraform. Takes the file to be converted on stdin.

Options:
      --version                   Show version number                                                                                                                                                              [boolean]
      --disable-plugin-cache-env  Dont set TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR automatically. This is useful when the plugin cache is configured differently. Supported using the env CDKTF_DISABLE_PLUGIN_CACHE_ENV.

      --log-level                 Which log level should be written. Only supported via setting the env CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL                                                                                             [string]
      --language                                                                                                                                 [choices: "typescript", "python", "csharp", "java"] [default: "typescript"]
      --provider                  The conversion needs to know which providers are used in addition to the ones in your cdktf.json file. We search for a cdktf.json below your current working directory.
                                                                                                                                                                                                       [array] [default: []]

  cat main.tf | cdktf convert  --provider integrations/github                                                     Takes the HCL content of main.tf and converts it to CDK for Terraform content and prints it
  cat main.tf | cdktf convert --provider hashicorp/aws > imported.ts                                              Takes the HCL content of main.tf and converts it to CDK for Terraform content in imported.ts

## synth

This command synthesizes Terraform configuration for an application. CDKTF stores the synthesized configuration in the `cdktf.out` directory, unless you use the `--output` flag to specify a different location. The output folder is ephemeral and might be erased for each `synth` that you run manually or that happens automatically when you run `deploy`, `diff`, or `destroy`.

```sh
$ cdktf synth --help
```

**Help Output**

```
cdktf synth [OPTIONS]

Synthesizes Terraform code for the given app in a directory.

Options:
  --version          Show version number                                                                                                                                           [boolean]

**Examples**

Synthesize code for an application.

```bash
$ cdktf synth
```

Synthesize code when providing a custom command to execute and an output directory.

```bash
$ cdktf synth --app="npm compile && node main.js" --output="dirname"
```

## watch

~> **Warning:** The `watch` command is experimental, so you should only use it in development environments. It also automatically deploys all changes without asking for confirmation.

When the `watch` command is first run it creates a `watchPattern` in your `cdktf.json` based on the language you configured. It's a list of glob patterns matching all files that should be watched.

Whenever a file matching the watch pattern is changed, the command will run `cdktf deploy --auto-approve` for you. It allows for rapid iterations when developing infrastructure, especially when working with serverless services. You can specify the stacks you want to deploy or you can use `cdktf watch --auto-approve '*'` to deploy all stacks.

### Requirements

Before using `watch` you should check your environment. The `watch` command should only be used for development environments. We recommend making sure that the terminal where you want to run `watch` has no access keys that allow the `cdktf-cli` to deploy to your production environment.

### Run watch

```sh
$ cdktf watch --help
```

**Help Output**

```

**Examples**

Run `watch` on the development stack (dev). The `--auto-approve` flag skips the explicit plan approval step and is currently always required.

```
cdktf watch dev --auto-approve
```

Besides for the required `--auto-approve` flag, you can use the same configuration options as in `cdktf deploy`.

### Troubleshoot watch

Set the `CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `all` and set `CDKTF_LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY` to your projects root directory.

The debug output is directed to a `cdktf.log` file in your projects root directory. The log contains information about detected file system changes and the actions they triggered.

### `--outputs-file`

The `--outputs-file` option allows you to specify a file where the stack outputs will be written as JSON.
The JSONs structure is matching your construct structure, the name of each construct is used as a key.

```jsonc
{
  "MyStack": {
    "MyConstructInstance": {
      "MyOutput": "my-value",
      "MySecretOutput": "my-secret-value" // not present if --outputs-file-include-sensitive-outputs is not set
    }
  }
}
```

Please be aware that sensitive outputs are only written to the file if the `--outputs-file-include-sensitive-outputs` option is used.

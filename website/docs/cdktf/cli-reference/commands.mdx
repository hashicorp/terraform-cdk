# CLI Commands

-> **Note:** CDK for Terraform is currently in [beta](/cdktf#project-maturity-and-production-readiness).

The CDK for Terraform CLI has the following commands:

- [completion](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#completion)
- [convert](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#convert)
- [deploy](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#deploy)
- [destroy](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#destroy)
- [diff](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#diff)
- [get](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#get)
- [init](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#init)
- [login](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#login)
- [synth](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#synth)
- [watch](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#watch)
- [output](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#output)

## completion

This command outputs a script that you can use to set up autocompletion for bash or zsh.

```
> cdktf completion

#compdef cdktf
###-begin-cdktf-completions-###
#
# yargs command completion script
#
# Installation: cdktf completion >> ~/.zshrc
#    or cdktf completion >> ~/.zsh_profile on OSX.
#
_cdktf_yargs_completions()
{
  local reply
  local si=$IFS
  IFS=$'
' reply=($(COMP_CWORD="$((CURRENT-1))" COMP_LINE="$BUFFER" COMP_POINT="$CURSOR" cdktf --get-yargs-completions "${words[@]}"))
  IFS=$si
  _describe 'values' reply
}
compdef _cdktf_yargs_completions cdktf
###-end-cdktf-completions-###

```

The output also contains the installation instructions. For example, here are the instructions for Mac OSX:

```
cdktf completion >> ~/.bash_profile on OSX.
# or if using zsh instead of bash
cdktf completion >> ~/.zshrc
```

After you configure auto completion, reload your shell by running `source ~/.zshrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile` or opening a new terminal window. You can now autocomplete `cdktf` commands by pressing the `<TAB>` key. You may need to enter a space after `cdktf` for autocomplete to take effect.

```
> cdktf <TAB>
completion  -- generate completion script
convert     -- Converts a single file of HCL configuration to CDK for Terraform. Takes the file to be converted on stdin.
deploy      -- Deploy the given stacks
destroy     -- Destroy the given stacks
diff        -- Perform a diff (terraform plan) for the given stack
get         -- Generate CDK Constructs for Terraform providers and modules.
init        -- Create a new cdktf project from a template.
list        -- List stacks in app.
login       -- Retrieves an API token to connect to Terraform Cloud.
synth       -- Synthesizes Terraform code for the given app in a directory.
watch       -- [experimental] Watch for file changes and automatically trigger a deploy
```

## convert

This command converts Terraform configuration written in HCL to the equivalent configuration in your preferred language.

->**Note**: The `convert` command is only functional for Terraform 1.0 and above. There are also [known limitations](https://cdk.tf/convert-limitations).

```

**Examples**

Fetch an API token from Terraform Cloud.

## synth

This command synthesizes Terraform configuration for an application. CDKTF stores the synthesized configuration in the `cdktf.out` directory, unless you use the `--output` flag to specify a different location. The output folder is ephemeral and might be erased for each `synth` that you run manually or that happens automatically when you run `deploy`, `diff`, or `destroy`.

```sh
$ cdktf synth --help
```

**Help Output**

```
cdktf synth [OPTIONS]

Synthesizes Terraform code for the given app in a directory.

Options:

```bash
$ cdktf synth
```

Synthesize code when providing a custom command to execute and an output directory.

```bash
$ cdktf synth --app="npm compile && node main.js" --output="dirname"

## watch

~> **Warning:** The `watch` command is experimental, so you should only use it in development environments. It also automatically deploys all changes without asking for confirmation.

The `watch` command watches a directory for changes and automatically synthesizes and deploys changes as they happen. It allows for rapid iterations when developing infrastructure, especially when working with serverless services. It currently supports only one stack at a time and automatically deploys changes without asking for confirmation.

Watch reads your root `.gitignore` file to determine which files trigger a `synth` and it uses the `outdir` of your `cdktf.json` (or the default `cdktf.out`) to do so for a deploy. It will generate a checksum of the subdirectory containing the Terraform code for your stack to skip deploys if the synthesized Terraform config did not change.

### Requirements

Before using `watch` you should:

- **Check your root `.gitignore` file.** Your root `.gitignore` must contain all files that are generated by `synth` and `deploy`. If that is not the case, the `watch` command will trigger itself and continuously try to deploy. Although Git supports nesting `.gitignore` files, the `watch` command currently only reads the root `.gitignore` file.

- **Check your environment.** The `watch` command should only be used for development environments. We recommend making sure that the terminal where you want to run `watch` has no access keys that allow the `cdktf-cli` to deploy to your production environment.

### Run watch

```sh
$ cdktf watch --help

### `--outputs-file`

The `--outputs-file` option allows you to specify a file where the stack outputs will be written as JSON.
The JSONs structure is matching your construct structure, the name of each construct is used as a key.

```jsonc
{
  "MyStack": {
    "MyConstructInstance": {
      "MyOutput": "my-value",
      "MySecretOutput": "my-secret-value" // not present if --outputs-file-include-sensitive-outputs is not set
    }
  }
}
```

Please be aware that sensitive outputs are only written to the file if the `--outputs-file-include-sensitive-outputs` option is used.

# CLI Commands

The CDK for Terraform CLI has the following commands:

- [completion](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#completion)
- [convert](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#convert)
- [debug](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#debug)
- [deploy](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#deploy)
- [destroy](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#destroy)
- [diff](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#diff)
- [get](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#get)
- [init](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#init)
- [login](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#login)
- [output](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#output)
- [provider add](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#provider-add)
- [provider upgrade](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#provider-upgrade)
- [provider list](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#provider-list)
- [synth](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#synth)
- [watch](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#watch)

## completion

This command outputs a script that you can use to set up autocompletion for bash or zsh.

```
> cdktf completion

#compdef cdktf
###-begin-cdktf-completions-###
#
# yargs command completion script
#
# Installation: cdktf completion >> ~/.zshrc
#    or cdktf completion >> ~/.zsh_profile on OSX.
#
_cdktf_yargs_completions()
{
  local reply
  local si=$IFS
  IFS=$'
' reply=($(COMP_CWORD="$((CURRENT-1))" COMP_LINE="$BUFFER" COMP_POINT="$CURSOR" cdktf --get-yargs-completions "${words[@]}"))
  IFS=$si
  _describe 'values' reply
}
compdef _cdktf_yargs_completions cdktf
###-end-cdktf-completions-###

```

The output also contains the installation instructions. For example, here are the instructions for Mac OSX:

```
cdktf completion >> ~/.bash_profile on OSX.
# or if using zsh instead of bash
cdktf completion >> ~/.zshrc
```

After you configure auto completion, reload your shell by running `source ~/.zshrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile` or opening a new terminal window. You can now autocomplete `cdktf` commands by pressing the `<TAB>` key. You may need to enter a space after `cdktf` for autocomplete to take effect.

```
> cdktf <TAB>
completion  -- generate completion script
convert     -- Converts a single file of HCL configuration to CDK for Terraform. Takes the file to be converted on stdin.
deploy      -- Deploy the given stacks
destroy     -- Destroy the given stacks
diff        -- Perform a diff (terraform plan) for the given stack
get         -- Generate CDK Constructs for Terraform providers and modules.
init        -- Create a new cdktf project from a template.
list        -- List stacks in app.
login       -- Retrieves an API token to connect to Terraform Cloud.
synth       -- Synthesizes Terraform code for the given app in a directory.
watch       -- [experimental] Watch for file changes and automatically trigger a deploy
```

## convert

This command converts Terraform configuration written in HCL to the equivalent configuration in your preferred language.

->**Note**: The `convert` command has [known limitations](https://cdk.tf/convert-limitations).

```
cdktf convert

Converts a single file of HCL configuration to CDK for Terraform. Takes the file to be converted on stdin.

Options:
      --version                   Show version number                                                                                                    [boolean]
      --disable-plugin-cache-env  Dont set TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR automatically. This is useful when the plugin cache is configured differently. Supported using the
                                  env CDKTF_DISABLE_PLUGIN_CACHE_ENV.                                                                   [boolean] [default: false]
      --log-level                 Which log level should be written. Only supported via setting the env CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL                                   [string]
      --language                                                                       [choices: "typescript", "python", "csharp", "java"] [default: "typescript"]
      --provider                  The conversion needs to know which providers are used in addition to the ones in your cdktf.json file. We search for a
                                  cdktf.json below your current working directory.                                                           [array] [default: []]
      --stack                     Wrap the generated code within a stack class                                                          [boolean] [default: false]

Examples:
  cat main.tf | cdktf convert  --provider integrations/github                        Takes the HCL content of main.tf and converts it to CDK for Terraform content
                                                                                     and prints it
  cat main.tf | cdktf convert --provider hashicorp/aws > imported.ts                 Takes the HCL content of main.tf and converts it to CDK for Terraform content
                                                                                     in imported.ts
  cat main.tf | cdktf convert --provider 'hashicorp/aws@ ~>3.62.0'                   Takes the HCL content of main.tf and converts it to CDK for Terraform content
  'integrations/github@ ~>4.16.0' --language python > imported.py                    in imported.py

```

**Examples**

Convert a local file.

```bash
cat main.tf | cdktf convert > imported.ts
```

Convert a local file and wrap it into a `cdktf.TerraformStack` instead of a `cdktf.Construct`.

```bash
cat main.tf | cdktf convert --stack > imported.ts
```

Convert HCL in your clipboard to Python on OSX.

```bash
pbpaste | cdktf convert --language python | pbcopy
```

```

~> **Note:** The `parallelism` flag has a different behavior than the [terraform parallelism flag](/terraform/cli/commands/apply#parallelism-n). To set the custom terraform parallelism flag, please use the `--terraform-parallelism` flag instead.

**Examples**

Deploy an application.

```bash
$ cdktf deploy
```

Deploy an application with automatic approval of the diff (Terraform plan).

```bash
$ cdktf deploy --auto-approve my-first-stack my-second-stack my-third-stack
```

Deploy multiple stacks in one run.

```bash
$ cdktf deploy my-first-stack my-second-stack my-third-stack
```

Deploy all stacks in one run:

```bash
$ cdktf deploy '*'
```

Deploy all stacks ending with `-production` in one run:

```bash
$ cdktf deploy '*-production'
```

If the stacks have dependencies (through cross stack references or by calling `myStack.addDependency(otherStack)`) deploy will figure out the right order to run.

For more info on the `--outputs-file` option, refer to the [`output` command](/terraform/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#output).

## destroy

This command destroys a given application.

```bash
$ cdktf destroy --help
```

Help output:

```

~> **Note:** The `parallelism` flag has a different behavior than the [terraform parallelism flag](/terraform/cli/commands/apply#parallelism-n). To set the custom terraform parallelism flag, please use the `--terraform-parallelism` flag instead.

**Examples**

Destroy an application.

```bash
$ cdktf destroy
```

Destroy an application with automatic approval of the diff (Terraform plan).

```bash
$ cdktf destroy --auto-approve
```

Destroy multiple stacks in one run.

```bash
$ cdktf destroy my-first-stack my-second-stack my-third-stack
```

Destroy all stacks in one run:

```bash
$ cdktf destroy '*'
```

Destroy all stacks ending with production in one run:

```bash
$ cdktf destroy '*-production'
```

If the stacks have dependencies (through cross stack references or by calling `myStack.addDependency(otherStack)`) deploy will figure out the right order to run.

## diff

This command generates a diff for a given application by running Terraform plan.

```bash
$ cdktf diff --help
```

Examples:

Generate a diff for a given application.

```bash
$ cdktf diff
```

## get

This command downloads the providers and modules for an application and
generates CDK constructs for them. It can use the `cdktf.json` configuration file to read the list of providers and modules.
This command only generates currently missing provider bindings, so it is very fast if nothing changed.
The command does not update the version when you specify loose version constraints in your `cdktf.json` file and have already generated an existing version locally. To update the version anyway, run `cdktf get --force` to recreate all bindings.

When you change a version constraint, the `cdktf get` command recreates the bindings for that provider.

```bash
$ cdktf get --help
```

**Help Output**

  cat my-token.txt | cdktf login                 Uses a locally stored token directly, instead of going through the interactive login process
```

Please note that we currently expect custom TFE instances to be using the `https` protocol.

**Examples**

Fetch an API token from Terraform Cloud.

```bash
$ cdktf login
```

## synth

This command synthesizes Terraform configuration for an application. CDKTF stores the synthesized configuration in the `cdktf.out` directory, unless you use the `--output` flag to specify a different location. The output folder is ephemeral and might be erased for each `synth` that you run manually or that happens automatically when you run `deploy`, `diff`, or `destroy`.

```sh
$ cdktf synth --help
```

**Help Output**

```
cdktf synth [OPTIONS]

```

**Examples**

Synthesize code for an application.

```bash
$ cdktf synth
```

Synthesize code when providing a custom command to execute and an output directory.

```bash
$ cdktf synth --app="npm compile && node main.js" --output="dirname"
```

## watch

~> **Warning:** The `watch` command is experimental, so you should only use it in development environments. It also automatically deploys all changes without asking for confirmation.

When the `watch` command is first run it creates a `watchPattern` in your `cdktf.json` based on the language you configured. It's a list of glob patterns matching all files that should be watched.

Whenever a file matching the watch pattern is changed, the command will run `cdktf deploy --auto-approve` for you. It allows for rapid iterations when developing infrastructure, especially when working with serverless services. You can specify the stacks you want to deploy or you can use `cdktf watch --auto-approve '*'` to deploy all stacks.

### Requirements

Before using `watch` you should check your environment. The `watch` command should only be used for development environments. We recommend making sure that the terminal where you want to run `watch` has no access keys that allow the `cdktf-cli` to deploy to your production environment.

### Run watch

```sh
$ cdktf watch --help
```

**Help Output**

```
cdktf watch [stacks..]

[experimental] Watch for file changes and automatically trigger a deploy

Positionals:
  stacks  Deploy stacks matching the given ids. Required when more than one stack is present in the app  [array] [default: []]

Options:
      --version                   Show version number  [boolean]
      --disable-plugin-cache-env  Dont set TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR automatically. This is useful when the plugin cache is configured differently. Supported using the env CDKTF_DISABLE_PLUGIN_CACHE_ENV.  [boolean] [default: false]
      --log-level                 Which log level should be written. Only supported via setting the env CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL  [string]
  -a, --app                       Command to use in order to execute cdktf app  [required]
  -o, --output                    Output directory for the synthesized Terraform config  [required] [default: "cdktf.out"]
      --auto-approve              Auto approve  [boolean] [default: false]
      --parallelism               Number of concurrent CDKTF stacks to run. Defaults to infinity, denoted by -1  [number] [default: -1]
      --terraform-parallelism     Forwards value as the `-parallelism` flag to Terraform. By default, the this flag is not forwarded to Terraform. Note: This flag is not supported by remote / cloud backend  [number] [default: -1]
  -h, --help                      Show help  [boolean]
```

~> **Note:** The `parallelism` flag has a different behavior than the [terraform parallelism flag](/terraform/cli/commands/apply#parallelism-n). To set the custom terraform parallelism flag, please use the `--terraform-parallelism` flag instead.

**Examples**

Run `watch` on the development stack (dev). The `--auto-approve` flag skips the explicit plan approval step and is currently always required.

```
cdktf watch dev --auto-approve
```

Besides for the required `--auto-approve` flag, you can use the same configuration options as in `cdktf deploy`.

### Troubleshoot watch

Set the `CDKTF_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `all` and set `CDKTF_LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY` to your projects root directory.

The debug output is directed to a `cdktf.log` file in your projects root directory. The log contains information about detected file system changes and the actions they triggered.

```

### `--outputs-file`

The `--outputs-file` option allows you to specify a file where the stack outputs will be written as JSON.
The JSONs structure is matching your construct structure, the name of each construct is used as a key.

```jsonc
{
  "MyStack": {
    "MyConstructInstance": {
      "MyOutput": "my-value",
      "MySecretOutput": "my-secret-value" // not present if --outputs-file-include-sensitive-outputs is not set
    }
  }
}
```

Please be aware that sensitive outputs are only written to the file if the `--outputs-file-include-sensitive-outputs` option is used.

## provider add

This command facilitates adding Terraform providers to a CDKTF project. If a [pre-built provider](/terraform/cdktf/concepts/providers#install-pre-built-providers) is available for the CDKTF version you are using and the Terraform provider version you requested (if any), it will be installed using e.g. `npm install` or `dotnet add` depending on the language you are using. Otherwise, the provider will be added to the `cdktf.json` config and `cdktf get` will be automatically invoked to generate [local provider bindings](/terraform/cdktf/concepts/providers#add-provider-to-cdktf-json).

```sh
$ cdktf provider add --help
```

**Help Output**

```
cdktf provider add <provider...>

Add one or more Terraform providers to your project.

Positionals:
  provider  Name of the provider to add. Can include a version constraint (e.g. aws@~>4.0).            [array] [required] [default: []]

Options:

```

**Examples**

Add the `aws` provider to the project. As the namespace of the AWS Terraform provider is `hashicorp` it can be left out.

```bash
$ cdktf provider add aws
```

Add a specific version of the `aws` provider to the project. You can use the `@` symbol to specify a [version constraint](/terraform/language/providers/requirements#version-constraints).

```bash
$ cdktf provider add aws@~>4.0
```

Add multiple providers to the project and force local generation of provider bindings.

```bash
$ cdktf provider add kreuzwerker/docker google --force-local
```

Add a provider from a private registry to the project.

```bash
$ cdktf provider add registry.example.com/acme/my-provider
```

## provider upgrade

This command lets you upgrade Terraform providers in a CDKTF project to the newest version compatible with your `cdktf` version. You can also optionally add a version constraint.

If your project has the associated [pre-built provider](/terraform/cdktf/concepts/providers#install-pre-built-providers) already installed, CDKTF updates the pre-built provider. Otherwise, CDKTF adds the provider to the `cdktf.json` configuration file and invokes `cdktf get` to generate [local provider bindings](/terraform/cdktf/concepts/providers#add-provider-to-cdktf-json).

```sh
$ cdktf provider upgrade --help
```

## provider list

This command prints out a table (or json with the `--json` option) containing details about the providers installed for the project. It gathers information for both locally built and pre-built providers.

Information printed varies between locally generated and prebuilt providers. The information for each provider includes the Terraform provider version, the CDKTF version, and the package name and version (if pre-built provider).

```sh
$ cdktf provider list --help
cdktf provider list [flags]

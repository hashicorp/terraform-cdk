# CLI Configuration

The CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) CLI allows you to initialize a new CDKTF project, adjust project settings, synthesize your infrastructure into Terraform configuration files, deploy your CDKTF application, and more. You can also use some Terraform CLI commands like `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy` directly, but we recommend using the available [`cdktf cli` commands](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands) where possible.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g cdktf-cli
```

## Use

```bash
$ cdktf --help
```

Help output:

```

Options can be specified via environment variables with the "CDKTF_" prefix (e.g. "CDKTF_OUTPUT")
```

### CI Environment

If you are running the CLI in an automated environment, you can force the dynamic CLI output rendering to be static by setting the `CI` environment variable to `true`.

## Configuration File

You can configure the behavior of the Terraform CDK CLI by modifying the `cdktf.json` file in your project root directory. Refer to the [cdktf.json documentation](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/configuration-file) for more detail on how you can supply custom configuration settings for your application.

## Telemetry

The CDKTF CLI ([cdktf-cli](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/tree/main/packages/cdktf-cli) interacts with a HashiCorp service called [Checkpoint](https://checkpoint.hashicorp.com)
to report project metrics such as cdktf version, project language, provider name, platform name, and other details that help guide the project maintainers with feature and roadmap decisions. The [code that interacts with Checkpoint](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/tree/main/packages/cdktf-cli/lib/checkpoint.ts) is part of the CDK for Terraform CLI.

The use of Checkpoint is completely optional. Refer to the [telemetry documentation](/cdktf/telemetry) for more information about Checkpoint and you can disable it if desired.

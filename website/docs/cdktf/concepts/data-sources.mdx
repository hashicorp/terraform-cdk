  Use data sources to allow Terraform to use external data, function output, and
  data from other configurations.

# Data Sources

[Terraform data sources](/language/data-sources) fetch information from external APIs and from other Terraform configurations. For example, you may want to import disk image IDs from a cloud provider or share data between configurations for different parts of your infrastructure.

## When to Use Data Sources

Use data sources when you need to reference dynamic data that is not known until after Terraform applies a configuration. For example, instance IDs that cloud providers assign on creation.

When data is static or you know the values before [synthesizing your code](/cdktf/cli-reference/commands#synth), we recommend creating static references in your preferred programming language or using [Terraform variables](/cdktf/concepts/variables-and-outputs).

## Define Data Sources

Data Sources are part of a [Terraform provider](/cdktf/concepts/providers). All classes representing Data Sources are prefixed with `Data`.

In the following TypeScript example, a Terraform data source fetches the AWS region `DataAwsRegion` from the AWS provider.

```typescript
// .....
import { DataAwsRegion } from "./gen/providers/aws/data-aws-region";

export class HelloTerraform extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    // .....
    const region = new DataAwsRegion(this, "region");
  }
}
```

## Remote State Data Source

The [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/language/state/remote-state-data) retrieves state data from a remote [Terraform backend](/language/settings/backends/configuration). This allows you to use the root-level outputs of one or more Terraform configurations as input data for another configuration. For example, a core infrastructure team can handle building the core machines, networking, etc. and then expose some information to other teams that allows them to run their own infrastructure. Refer to the [Remote Backends page](/cdktf/concepts/remote-backends) for more details.

The following TypeScript example uses the global `DataTerraformRemoteState` to reference a Terraform Output of another Terraform configuration.

```typescript
// .....
import { DataTerraformRemoteState } from 'cdktf';

export class HelloTerraform extends TerraformStack {
    constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
        super(scope, id);

        .....
        const remoteState = new DataTerraformRemoteState(this, {
            organization: 'hashicorp',
            workspaces: {
                name: 'vpc-prod'
            }
        });

        new Instance(this, 'foo', {
            // ....
            subnetId: remoteState.get('subnet_id')
        });
    }
}
```

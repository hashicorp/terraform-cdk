# Remote Backends

Terraform stores [state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/index.html) about managed infrastructure to map real-world resources to the configuration, keep track of metadata, and improve performance. Terraform stores this state in a local file by default, but you can also use a Terraform [remote backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/remote.html) to store state remotely.

You can configure your remote backend to be [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html), one of CDK for Terraform's [supported backends](#supported-backends), or a custom location.


## When to Use Remote Backends

Consider using a remote backend when multiple individuals or teams need access to your infrastructure state data.

[Remote state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/remote.html) makes it easier for teams to work together because all members have access to the latest state data in the remote store. It also allows you to share output values with other configurations, allowing groups to share infrastructure resources. For example, a core infrastructure team can handle building the core machines, networking, etc. and can expose some information to other teams to run their own infrastructure.

## Define Remote Backends

You can define a [JSON configuration for a remote backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax-json.html#terraform-blocks)
with a `TerraformBackend` subclass or a JSON configuration file.

### `TerraformBackend` Subclass

A `TerraformBackend` subclass like `RemoteBackend` below synthesizes to the required remote backend JSON configuration in the autogenerated `cdk.tf.json` file.

TODO: We're passing in stack here. Is that the state file? Can you explain what that's doing?

   ```typescript
   const stack = new MyStack(app, "hello-terraform");
   new RemoteBackend(stack, {
     hostname: "app.terraform.io",
     organization: "company",
     workspaces: {
       name: "my-app-prod",
     },
   });
   ```

### Create a JSON File

Create a JSON file called `remote.tf.json` in the `cdktf.out` stack sub-directory containing the synthesized CDKTF code.

For example, for a stack called `hello-terraform`, you would store this file in `cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform`. This directory contains the synthesized code that CDKTF generates when you run `cdktf synth`.

```bash
cd cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform
vim remote.tf.json
```

```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "remote": {
        "hostname": "app.terraform.io",
        "organization": "company",
        "workspaces": {
          "name": "my-app-prod"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The stack output directory is as follows.

```bash
tree .
.
├── cdk.tf.json
└── remote.tf.json
```

## Initialize Remote Backends

Run `terraform init` to initialize a Terraform remote backend.

TODO: Does it matter where they run it (which directory?) also this is a terraform command... is there not a `cdktf` command that will do this? If you use a remote backend, can you no longer deploy and manage your infrastructure with CDKTF?

```shell
$ terraform init
```

## Migrate Local State Storage to Remote

After you define your remote backend, you need to actually move the Terraform state file to the CDK for Terraform output directory.  

Consider this example project called `hello-terraform` that is using local storage to store the Terraform state.

```bash
cd hello-terraform
```

Add remote state backend using TerraformBackend.

```bash
vim main.ts
```

```typescript
const stack = new MyStack(app, "hello-terraform");
new RemoteBackend(stack, {
  hostname: "app.terraform.io",
  organization: "company",
  workspaces: {
    name: "my-app-prod",
  },
});
```

Synthesize application.

```bash
cdktf synth
```

Move Terraform state file into the output directory.

```bash
mv terraform.hello-terraform.tfstate cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform
```

Run Terraform init.

```bash
cd cdktf.out/stacks/hello-terraform
terraform init


Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "remote" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "remote" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "remote"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes


Successfully configured the backend "remote"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...

.....
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

```

Validate state migration by running the `cdktf diff` command in the root `hello-terraform`

```bash
cd ../../..
```

```bash
cdktf diff
```

There are no changes to the stack.

TODO: I see that there are no changes, but why is that a good thing? And how can we verify that the state has been migrated?

```bash
Stack: hello-terraform

Diff: 0 to create, 0 to update, 0 to delete.

```

# Supported Backends

## Escape Hatches

Escape hatches are objects that can add to or override existing resources. You can use them for backends or backend constructs that CDKTF does not natively support.

TODO: Please explain the actual method that you call and how you use it. Is it just .addOverride on the object where you need to override the default behavior? What arguments does it support?

Use a Stack Escape Hatch](./stacks.html) to configure unsupported backends.

```typescript
stack.addOverride("terraform.backend", {
  atlas: {
    name: "example_corp/networking-prod",
    address: "https://app.terraform.io",
  },
});
```

Use escape hatches to override behavior on backend constructs. In this TypeScript example, TODO: please explain why we needed to use an escape hatch here.

```typescript
const backend = new RemoteBackend(stack, {...});
backend.addOverride('organization', 'my_other_company');
```

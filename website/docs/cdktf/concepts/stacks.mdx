# Stacks

A stack represents a collection of infrastructure that CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) synthesizes as a dedicated Terraform configuration. Stacks allow you to separate the state management for multiple environments within an application.

## Scope

You can instantiate the same resource multiple times throughout your infrastructure. For example, you may want to create multiple S3 Buckets with different configurations. Instances that share the same `stack` parent element are considered to be part of the same scope. You must set a different `name` property for each instance to avoid naming conflicts.

Refer to the [constructs documentation](/cdktf/concepts/constructs#scope) for more details and an example.

## Single Stack

The following example generates a single Terraform configuration in the configured output folder. When you run `cdktf synth`, the synthesized Terraform configuration will be in the folder `cdktf.out/stacks/a-single-stack`

```typescript
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
import { AwsProvider, EC2 } from "./.gen/providers/aws";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    new AwsProvider(this, "aws", {
      region: "us-east-1",
    });

    new EC2.Instance(this, "Hello", {
      ami: "ami-2757f631",
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, "a-single-stack");
app.synth();
```

## Multiple Stacks

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Deploy Multiple Lambda Functions with TypeScript](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cdktf-assets-stacks-lambda?in=terraform/cdktf) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn. This tutorial guides you through a multi-stack application.

You can specify multiple stacks in your application. For example, you may want a separate configuration for development, testing, and production environments.

The following example synthesizes multiple Terraform configurations in the configured output folder.

```typescript
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
import { AwsProvider, EC2 } from "./.gen/providers/aws";

interface MyStackConfig {
  environment: string;
  region?: string;
}

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, config: MyStackConfig) {
    super(scope, id);

    const { region = "us-east-1" } = config;

    new AwsProvider(this, "aws", {
      region,
    });

    new EC2.Instance(this, "Hello", {
      ami: "ami-2757f631",
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
      tags: {
        environment: config.environment,
      },
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, "multiple-stacks-dev", { environment: "dev" });
new MyStack(app, "multiple-stacks-staging", { environment: "staging" });
new MyStack(app, "multiple-stacks-production-us", {
  environment: "production",
  region: "us-east-1",
});
new MyStack(app, "multiple-stacks-production-eu", {
  environment: "production",
  region: "eu-central-1",
});
app.synth();
```

Running `cdktf synth` produces the following synthesized stacks.

```
$ cdktf list

Stack name                      Path
multiple-stacks-dev             cdktf.out/stacks/multiple-stacks-dev
multiple-stacks-staging         cdktf.out/stacks/multiple-stacks-staging
multiple-stacks-production-us   cdktf.out/stacks/multiple-stacks-production-us
multiple-stacks-production-eu   cdktf.out/stacks/multiple-stacks-production-eu
```

To deploy and destroy multiple stacks at once, either specify multiple stacks in the `cdktf deploy` and `cdktf destroy` command or use a wild card glob (e.g., `cdktf deploy '*-production'`).

Refer to [Best Practices](/cdktf/create-and-deploy/best-practices#separate-business-units-with-stacks) for more details about when to create multiple stacks and how to structure them.

### Cross-Stack References

When you reference resources from one stack in another stack, you can do so by exposing the resource in the source stack and referencing it in the target stack.

```typescript
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
import { AwsProvider } from "./.gen/providers/aws";
import { Vpc } from "./my-aws-vpc-construct";
import { DockerBackend } from "./my-docker-backend-construct";

class VPCStack extends TerraformStack {
  public vpc: Vpc;
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, public region = "us-east-1") {
    super(scope, id);

    new AwsProvider(this, "aws", {
      region,
    });

    this.vpc = new Vpc(this, "vpc", {});
  }
}

interface BackendStackConfig {
  region: string;
  vpcId: string;
  dockerImage: string;
}
class BackendStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, config: BackendStackConfig) {
    super(scope, id);

    const { region, vpcId, dockerImage } = config;

    new AwsProvider(this, "aws", {
      region,
    });

    new DockerBackend(this, "docker-backend", {
      vpcId,
      dockerImage,
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
const origin = new VPCStack(app, "origin-stack");
new BackendStack(app, "target-stack", {
  region: origin.region,
  vpcId: origin.vpc.id,
  dockerImage: "org/my-image:latest",
});

app.synth();
```

From a usage perspective it looks like we are accessing the `id` value of `vpc` from the `origin-stack` instance of `VpcStack` and then referencing it in the `target-stack` instance of `BackendStack`.
Accessing a value from a different stack causes the value to be exported as `TerraformOutput` in the origin stack.
The value is than accessed through a `TerraformRemoteState` in the target stack.
Both are automatically added to the respective stacks to make the process seemless.

When you are using Terraform Cloud it's necessary for each stack to be it's own workspace.
This means that you need to create a separate workspace for each stack and you need to [set the permissions to allow access between the stacks](/cloud-docs/workspaces/state#remote-state-access-controls).

### Stack Dependencies

We add the stack dependencies in the `cdktf.out/manifest.json` file for each stack under `dependencies`.
By default a stack is dependant on another stack when the data used origins in that stack.
If you e.g. write `this.allResources = Fn.mergeLists(resourceFromStackA.items, resourceFromStackB.items)` in Stack C and use `stackC.allResources` in Stack D, Stack D will be dependant on Stack A and B, but not C since that is not the origin of the data.

To make the dependency explicit, run`stackD.addDependency(stackC)`.

If you want to keep the result of the function attached to one stack and save its state, create a [Terraform Local value](/cdktf/concepts/variables-and-outputs#local-values) and expose it. The following example creates a `TerraformLocal`.

```ts
this.allResources = TerraformLocal(this, "merged_items", Fn.mergeLists(resourceFromStackA.items, resourceFromStackB.items)
```

The CLI will error if you deploy your application without first deploying the dependencies. It will also error if you try to destroy infrastructure without destroying the dependent stacks first. To remove these safeguards, add the `--ignore-missing-stack-dependencies` to the `deploy` and `destroy` commands.

### Migration from `<= 0.2`

Until version `0.2`, CDKTF only supported a single stack. For local state handling, CDKTF used a `terraform.tfstate` in the project root folder. With version `>= 0.3`, the local state file reflects the stack name it belongs to in its file name. When a `terraform.tfstate` file is still present in the project root folder, it has to be renamed to match the schema `terraform.<stack-name>.tfstate` manually.

## Escape Hatch

For anything on the top-level `terraform` block that is not natively implemented, use the **stack escape hatch** to define a configuration. For example, define remote backend using the `addOverride` method in TypeScript.

~> **Important**: Escape hatches **must not** have empty arguments or objects, because CDKTF removes them from the synthesized JSON configuration.

The following example synthesizes a Terraform configuration with the `remote` backend included in the `terraform` block.

```typescript
stack.addOverride("terraform.backend", {
  remote: {
    organization: "test",
    workspaces: {
      name: "test",
    },
  },
});
```

The following configuration snippet shows the `remote` backend configuration.

```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "required_providers": {
      "aws": "~> 2.0"
    },
    "backend": {
      "remote": {
        "organization": "test",
        "workspaces": {
          "name": "test"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

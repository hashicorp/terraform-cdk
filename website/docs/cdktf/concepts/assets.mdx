# Assets

In CDK for Terraform (CDKTF) v0.4+, asset constructs can manage assets for resources that need them, such as template_file, S3 bucket objects, or Lambda function archive files. You can use Terraform assets to move existing files or directories into your CDKTF application so that you can use them in resource definitions.

Assets are especially useful for:

- Copying over previously generated zip files with Lambda functions.
- Deploying static local files to S3.

## Usage Example

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Deploy Multiple Lambda Functions with TypeScript](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cdktf-assets-stacks-lambda?in=terraform/cdktf) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn. This tutorial guides you through using a `TerraformAsset` to archive a Lambda function, uploading the archive to an S3 bucket, then deploying the Lambda function.

The following TypeScript example uses `TerraformAsset` to upload the contents of the specified directory into an S3 Bucket. The `TerraformAsset` is responsible for making sure the directory ends up in the correct output folder as a zip file that the `S3BucketObject` can reference.

The stack output directory in `cdktf.out` contains all of the assets that `TerraformAsset` needs. This is important for workflows where you use synthesized configurations with Terraform directly. For example, you would only need to upload the contents of the stack output folder to Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.

```typescript
import * as path from "path";
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack, TerraformAsset, AssetType } from "cdktf";
import { AwsProvider } from "./.gen/providers/aws/aws-provider";
import { S3BucketObject } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket-object";
import { S3Bucket } from "./.gen/providers/aws/s3-bucket";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);

    new AwsProvider(this, "provider", {
      region: "us-west-2",
    });

    const bucket = new S3Bucket(this, "bucket", {
      bucket: "demo",
    });

    const asset = new TerraformAsset(this, "lambda-asset", {
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, "../lambda"),
      type: AssetType.ARCHIVE, // if left empty it infers directory and file
    });

    new S3BucketObject(this, "lambda-archive", {
      bucket: bucket.bucket,
      key: asset.fileName,
      source: asset.path, // returns a posix path
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, "demo");
app.synth();
```

## Paths

Assets support both absolute and relative paths. Relative paths are always considered to be relative to your project's `cdktf.json` file.

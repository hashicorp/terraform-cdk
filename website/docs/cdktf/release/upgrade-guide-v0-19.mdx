# Upgrading to CDK for Terraform Version 0.19

0.19 brings new workflows to import existing resources from cloud providers and refactor exisiting resources in your CDKTF project.

### Minimum required Node.js version updated to 18.12

Since the long-term support for Node.js 16 ended on 2023-09-11, we updated our minimum compatible Node.js version to 18.12.

## Potential provider naming collision with instance function `moveTo` on `TerraformResource`

We have added support for resource refactoring and renaming with the addition of the instance function `moveTo` on `TerraformResource`. We forsee the potential for naming collision with providers using `moveTo` as an attribute. In instances where provider bindings fail to compile due to the collision, regenerate your provider bindings and replace the provider related usage of `moveTo` to `moveToAttribute` in your configuration if applicable.

### Java: `codeMakerOutput` needs to be set to a company identifier

We did not honor the `codeMakerOutput` setting in the `cdktf.json` previously, this is fixed now.
To have no changes in the generated code you can set `codeMakerOutput: "imports"`.
If you like, you can now set it to your company name, e.g. `codeMakerOutput: "com.hashicorp"` so that the provider is generated under the `com.hashicorp.aws` namespace for example. Omitting the `codeMakerOutput` will lead to the default value `.gen` being used and results in an error.

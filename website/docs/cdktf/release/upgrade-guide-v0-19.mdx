# Upgrading to CDK for Terraform Version 0.19

0.19 brings new workflows to import existing resources from cloud providers and refactor exisiting resources in your CDKTF project.

## Potential provider naming collision with instance function `moveTo` on `TerraformResource`

We have added support for resource refactoring and renaming with the addition of the instance function `moveTo` on `TerraformResource`. We forsee the potential for naming collision with providers using `moveTo` as an attribute. In instances where provider bindings fail to compile due to the collision, regenerate your provider bindings and replace the provider related usage of `moveTo` to `moveToAttribute` in your configuration if applicable.

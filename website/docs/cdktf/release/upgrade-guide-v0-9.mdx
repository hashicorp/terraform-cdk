# Upgrading to CDK for Terraform Version 0.9

We changed some provider bindings to work better across all languages.

### Standardize IResolvable Usage [#1299](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/pull/1299)

This is an effort to make sure attributes can be freely passed between resources for all different types.

There is a minor breaking change:

- `count` on resources and data sources has gone from `number | cdktf.IResolvable` to `number`. If code was previously passing an `IResolvable`, it will now need to wrap the `IResolvable` using `Token.asNumber()` on Typescript and Java , `Token.AsNumer()` on C#, `cdktf.Token_AsNumber()` on Go, and `Token().as_string()` on Python.

### Map Tokens [#1411](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/pull/1411)

As part of an effort to use more native types, there are now tokens for maps of primitive values.

As a result, there is a minor breaking change:

- Map attributes have gone from `{ [key: string]: TYPE } | cdktf.IResolvable` to `{ [key: string]:TYPE }` when `TYPE` is `string, number, or boolean`.
  - The most common impact is maps created by using Terraform functions (`Fn.(...)`) will now need to be passed to `Token.as<String/Number/Boolean>Map()` before assigning to a resource attribute. The naming is a bit different per language, on C# it's `Token.As<String/Number/Boolean>Map()`, on Go it's `cdktf.Token_As<String/Number/Boolean>Map()`, and on Python it's `Token().as_<string/number/boolean>_map()`.

### Number[] Tokens [#1471](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk/pull/1471)

As part of an effort to use more native types, there are now tokens for `number[]`.
This is mostly an internal change, but there is now `Token.asNumberList()` (on C# it's `Token.AsNumberList()`, on Go it's `cdktf.Token_AsNumberList`, on Python it's `Token().as_number_list()`) which can be used to convert other values into `number[]`.

As a result of some standardization, there is a minor breaking change:

- Boolean[] attributes have gone from `boolean[]` to `Array<boolean | IResolvable> | IResolvable`.
  - This is done because neither `boolean` or `boolean[]` is representable by a token.
  - This should make it easier to pass around `boolean[]` between resources and fuctions.
  - For jsii languages (especially Java and C#), these types will end up as `List<Object>`.

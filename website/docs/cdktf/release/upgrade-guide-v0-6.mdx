# Upgrading to CDK for Terraform Version 0.6

CDK for Terraform version 0.6 uses [`constructs`](https://github.com/aws/constructs) version 10. If you are using more advanced APIs from the `constructs` library, refer to the [Constructs API Changes](#constructs-api-changes) section.

## Background

Since version 0.6 the `cdktf` package depends on `constructs` v10 (formerly was v3). While that jump might look big, v10 is actually going to be the next major version after v3. We made this change because the `constructs` lib v10 is supposed to stay around for a while and is supposed to offer a very stable API.

To achieve this stability in the core functionality a lot has been removed from v10. For further background information you can read into the [PR for v10](https://github.com/aws/constructs/pull/263) or the AWS CDK RFC [Removal of Construct Compatibility Layer](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/blob/master/text/0192-remove-constructs-compat.md).

While using the v0.6 `cdktf-cli` to deploy stacks that are using an older version of `cdktf` and `constructs` should still work, we recommend upgrading the `cdktf` and `constructs` packages.

## Pre-built providers

All upcoming releases of the [pre-built providers](https://cdk.tf/prebuilt-providers) will depend on `constructs` v10. So we recommend to upgrade your project.
If you cannot upgrade the `cdktf` version, you can switch to [generating provider bindings](/cdktf/concepts/providers#import-providers) via `cdktf get`.

## Upgrading a TypeScript / JavaScript CDKTF project

To upgrade a TypeScript or JavaScript CDKTF project, adjust the versions in the `package.json` file of your project.

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "cdktf": "^0.6.0",
    "constructs": "^10.0.5"
  }
}
```

Afterwards run `npm install` to update the depedencies and `cdktf get` to re-generate the provider bindings if you don't only use pre-built providers.

## Upgrading a Python CDKTF project

### `pipenv` (`python`-template)

To upgrade a Python CDKTF project using `pipenv`, adjust the versions in the `Pipfile` of your project.

```toml
[packages]
cdktf = "~=0.6.0"
```

Afterwards run `pipenv install` to update the depedencies and `cdktf get` to re-generate the provider bindings if you don't only use pre-built providers.

### Pip3 (`python-pip`-template)

To upgrade a Python CDKTF project using `pip3`, adjust the versions in the `requirements.txt` of your project.

```
cdktf~=0.6.0
```

Afterwards run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to update the depedencies and `cdktf get` to re-generate the provider bindings if you don't only use pre-built providers.

## Upgrading a Java CDKTF project

To upgrade a Java CDKTF project, adjust the versions in the `pom.xml` file of your project.

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.hashicorp</groupId>
      <artifactId>cdktf</artifactId>
      <version>0.6.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.constructs</groupId>
      <artifactId>constructs</artifactId>
      <version>10.0.5</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <!-- ... -->
</project>
```

Afterwards run `mvn install` to update the depedencies and `cdktf get` to re-generate the provider bindings if you don't only use pre-built providers.

## Upgrading a CSharp CDKTF project

To upgrade a C# CDKTF project, adjust the versions in the `*.csproj` file of your project.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <!-- ... -->
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="HashiCorp.Cdktf" Version="0.6.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Afterwards run `dotnet restore` to update the depedencies and `cdktf get` to re-generate the provider bindings if you don't only use pre-built providers.

## Upgrading a Golang CDKTF project

To upgrade a Golang CDKTF project, adjust the versions in the `go.mod` file of your project.

```
require github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs/v10 v10.0.5
require github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-go/cdktf v0.6.0
```

Afterwards run `go get` to update the depedencies and `cdktf get` to re-generate the provider bindings if you don't only use pre-built providers.

You also need to adjust all imports to refer to `constructs/v10` instead of `constructs/v3`.

```
import (
	"github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs/v10"
)
```

## Constructs API Changes

### `Aspects` moved to `cdktf`

`Aspects` are now part of `cdktf` as they've been removed from `constructs`. If you use them, you need to change your import statement to import them from the `cdktf` package. The API also has changed a bit:

```typescript
// to register Aspects, use
import { Aspects } from "cdktf"; // new
Aspects.of(construct).add(aspect);

// instead of
construct.node.applyAspect(aspect); // old
```

### `construct.node.addInfo()` / `addWarning()` / `addError()` moved to `Annotations`

The aforementioned methods are now available via the `Annotations` API:

```typescript
// use
import { Annotations } from "cdktf"; // new
Annotations.of(construct).addInfo("hello");

// instead of
construct.node.addInfo("hello"); // old
```

Annotations will also be printed by the `cdktf-cli` after your stack was synthesized. One ore more `error` annotations will make the `synth` fail.

### `onPrepare()` and `prepare()` have been removed

```typescript
// use
import { Aspects } from "cdktf";
class MyConstruct extends Construct {
  constructor(scope: IConstruct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    Aspects.of(this).add({
      visit: (node: IConstruct) => {
        // visit will also be called on any childs of this construct
        if (node === this) console.log("some work");
      },
    });
  }
}

// instead of
class MyConstruct extends Construct {
  onPrepare() {
    console.log("some work");
  }
}
```

### `onSynthesize` has been removed

Should you need support for this, please file a [new issue](https://cdk.tf/feature) on this repo and describe your use-case.

## Further support

If you encounter anything that is missing from this guide or not working as expected, please don't hesitate to file a [bug](https://cdk.tf/bug) so we can improve this guide.
